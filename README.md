# Colonel-Blotto
## Solving The Colonel Blotto Game theory Problem
Currently only the naive solution is in the repo. Hoping to add more as I learn more and not only impliment a more efficient less brute force algorithm but also add a larger version of the game.

Note that currently I differntiate options that are technically the same for example (0,2,3) is distinct from (2,3,0). Technically (2,3,0) is correct in any form (note (4,1,0) in all it's forms is not a statisfactory exploit and will lose in the long run) but to compute it's sucess in a game vs all strategies you would to the best of my knoweldge need all of it's permutations to determine it's sucess against other strategies.
